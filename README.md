# Strategy for the infrastructure for IETF IT services
This repository is the authoritative source for the [strategy](https://github.com/ietf-tools/infrastructure-strategy/blob/main/strategy.md) for a new infrastructure for IETF services. It was agreed in late 2022 by the IETF community after extensive discussion on a [proposal](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tools-discuss/3wPooZssbIWCzYh1VNBqTly_SxU/) and [revised proposal](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tools-discuss/Af8pxpCg5Xa3IysQbfejndWlrmA/) on the tools-discuss list.

This strategy was then incorporated into an [RFI](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_Infrastructure_Services_RFI.pdf) and an [RFP](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_RFP_-_Infrastructure_Services.pdf)

Any proposed changes to this strategy should be taken to the tools-discuss list.
